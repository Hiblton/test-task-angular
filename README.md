## Starting the App

Run `npm i` to install dependencies first, and then run `ng s` to start the app.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Tasks

Take the existing project from the provided archive and complete the following tasks:
- [x] Create an array of forms and submit them as one
- [x] After submitting the forms, display a timer and provide the option to cancel the
submission
- [x] Create Directive for tooltip

## Notes (for real projects)

- All string values, such as FormControl names and validation error names, should be stored and managed in one place (constants, enums, or a configuration file).
- The responsive layout can be improved.
- Accessibility (A11Y) can be enhanced by setting appropriate attributes.
- Internationalization (I18N) can be added.
- State management tools and model classes can be used for a more complex architecture.
- Tests can be extended (boilerplate code for tests was generated by GenAI).
